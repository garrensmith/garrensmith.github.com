================

<p id="meta" class="meta"> 1 Aug 2011 - Johannesburg </p>

Today is my first day at [Red Comet Labs](http://www.redcometlabs.com). So far so good. The dress code is quite relaxed, work seems interesting and the boss is quite a funny guy. Though I could be biased as I am the boss. 

I've spent the last 18 months working for [Driven Software](http://www.drivensoftware.net) and its been a fantastic experience.
I've learnt quite a lot, especially working with developers and helping teams to achieve agile greatness! 
However I've reached a point now where I want to spend more time developing. After plenty of thinking and discussing with my wife, I've decided to start my own company. 

[Red Comet Labs](http://www.redcometlabs.com) launches today. I'm going to start small and grow the company organically. I'm going to be focusing on doing contract work and freelance work for a while, though I do have some product ideas I am going to pursue. I'm going to stick to projects involving Ruby on Rails and hopefully a little bit of nodejs. I really love the communities that have formed up around these technologies and the collaboration has been a real breath of fresh air compared to other technology stacks that I have worked on. 

So if you want to discuss any business opportunities or just wish me luck, please <a href="mailto:info@redcometlabs.com"> send me a mail</a>.
