</div><div><a href="http://kevint.drivensoftware.com/">Kevin</a> asked me about two months ago to come join him at Driven Software and I couldn't resist. The work looks to be really interesting and to get some proper experience in a Agile/Scrum environment is exactly what I want.</div><div>
</div><div>Will be changing my blog profile </div><div>soon to reflect this.</div><div>
</div><div>Oh and some added extra news is I have managed to convince myself that the only possible laptop that could make me successful in my new role with Driven Software is a Macbook Pro... Cant wait :-)</div><div>
