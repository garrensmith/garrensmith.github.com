<p>I've been trying to learn git and I've decided that the next way to really get famliar with it is to use it with one of the teams I am on. They are using svn, so I have used git-svn to create the the mapper between the two. I wrote up a cheat sheet for myself with git flow I want to use and the reference links I used. If anyone can recommend any improvements let me know.</p>
