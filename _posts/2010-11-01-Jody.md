<p id="meta" class="meta"> . 1 Nov 2010 - St Helena </p>

I have been really interested in investigating Nodejs and Javascript. I decided the best way to get to know them would be to write some sort of library for it. 

I followed some [advice](http://neversaw.us/2010/8/26/the-learning-spiral/) and reinvented the wheel and wrote a BDD framework. I've been reading a beta version of the Rspec book on my kindle so I've tried to use the knowledge I gained from that to help with the api of the framework. 

The main aims of the library is to have a nice fluent api. Have matchers like Rspec using Should and to learn Javascript. Also support async testing of callbacks. I'm really happy how it has turned out. I think I have learnt more about Javascript than Nodejs with it but its a good start. 

To write it I read a lot of code and so kudo's has to go to TJ and his [Expresso](http://github.com/visionmedia/expresso), I used that as inspiration for a lot of my implementation. 

To install
    npm install Jody

Please give it a try and let me know what you think. Patches welcome!
