I haven't had much chance to do much Beagleboarding, but that is my fault. As my <a href="http://www.360voice.com/tag/J1mmaZA">xbo306 blog</a> will say I've been busy... I just bought the new <a href="http://gearsofwar.xbox.com/">Gears of War 2</a> and its awesome. Been playing a lot of Horde mode with some friends. Its a lot of fun and totally my type of game play.... lots and lots of killing of bad guys with big gun.

Only into the second act of the single player but so far really enjoying it.

I have in the meantime also been looking at<a href="http://wiki.openembedded.net/index.php/Main_Page"> OpenEmbedded</a> and trying to build images with that. Its a little difficult with the Bandwidth limits we have in South Africa. The <a href="http://elinux.org/BeagleBoardAndOpenEmbeddedGit">tutorial</a> for setting up OE is very complete and useful. Will report back on this when I've learnt more...
