Since I started work a year ago, I've been reading as many software books as I could get my hands on to improve my programming chops. I've recently come across some really nice free resources that are both very useful and quite short and sweet.

<a href="http://www.infoq.com/minibooks/domain-driven-design-quickly">Domain Driven Design Quickly</a> is a really good summary of writing software using the Domain Driven methodology. Its only about 80 pages and really useful. It explains some useful patterns eg Repository, aggregates and others.

<a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/karlseguin/archive/2008/06/24/foundations-of-programming-ebook.aspx">Foundations of Programming</a> is more .net orientated but a really good read. It discusses some of the good frameworks out there like NHibernate and has a nice intro into unit testing. It also has a really useful chapter on memory with .net.

My next free ebook that I will read is <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/content/pablo_ebook.aspx">Pablo's SOLID Software Development</a> which to be a great intro into using the SOLID principles while developing.

While researching this post I came across this link from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4705/free-programming-ebooks">StackOverFlow</a> which gives a really good list of Free ebooks. So hopefully everyones favorite language is covered.
