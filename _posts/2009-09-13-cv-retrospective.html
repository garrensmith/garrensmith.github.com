I recently had to update my CV or for my American readers, my resume. Initially I had writers block so I avoided it for a couple days. However after some research I eventually stopped procrastinating and got down to it.<div>
</div><div>A CV is always tricky business as you don't want to come across as a bragger or worse under sell yourself. Finding the correct balance is always tricky. Trying to keep it brief and insightful is important, along with making it appeal to your audience. </div><div>
</div><div><div>I founds some really useful blogs on writing a good, eye catching CV. I certainly think they will appeal to managers as well as fellow developers. If you're in the process of writing your own CV, I'd suggest checking them out:</div><div>
</div><div><a href="http://www.codesqueeze.com/category/3-days-building-a-perfect-resume/">Max Pool, on his blog Codequeeze</a> has written a nice couple of articles covering some useful topics and he also supplies a nice template to get you started</div><div>
</div><div><a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2007/02/25/a_glimpse_and_a_hook.html">Rands, on his blog RandinRepose</a> writes about a few key items that need to be included in your CV, in order to catch a manager's eye. I assure you that all of them are absolutely legal! In fact they are incredible gems that will make your CV stand out from all the others in pile.</div></div><div>
</div><div>Writing a CV is also a great <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective">retrospective</a> to see what you have achieved since you last updated it. I realised that I am a bit of a Jack of all Trades and probably should look at focusing a bit more. </div><div>
</div><div>I strongly recommend updating your CV every 6 months even if its just a way at reflecting on your progress as a developer. Why not just hand it out to friends and family to determine if its a good reflection of you and you never know what contacts will emerge.</div><div>
