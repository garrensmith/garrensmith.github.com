Last Saturday I did a [CodeRetreat](http://www.coderetreat.org) with [Corey Haines](http://coreyhaines.com/) at [RubyFuza](http://www.rubyfuza.org). It was a great and humbling experience. It showed how important
it is to continually practise your coding skills. Corey had four important points for better design that I haphazardly wrote down on a scrap of paper. I feel they deserve more respect than that. 

Essentially, in order to design better software, we need to write it so that it is **easier to change**. These points, listed in order of importance, help to achieve that.

1. Passing tests
2. Your code should reveal intent
3. There should be no code duplication
4. Write short methods that do one thing.  

Read these two great explanations by [JBrains](http://www.jbrains.ca/permalink/the-four-elements-of-simple-design) and [Corey Haines](http://blog.coderetreat.com/) to follow the path to enlightenment.

I plan to spend the next couple of weeks trying to achieve this when writing code. Do you think these points are in the correct order? Any points that should be added?
