So it is only polite to give a quick hello and introduce myself.

I'm an embedded software developer. I've been using Linux for about 2 years now since edgy eft.

Lately, with what spare time I have, I've been getting into Embedded Linux. I bought a <a href="http://www.beagleboard.org/">Beagleboard</a> while in the UK recently. So a lot of my posts will probably be on that. And other development tools that I tinker with.

I've only recently joined the Ubuntu-ZA community and I look forward to contributing as best as I can.
